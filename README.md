# "Ubuntu from scratch" installation "guide"

Note: This isn't meant to be any end-to-end installation guide for anybody. It is more a lose guidance for me when ever I need to setup any computer with a fresh Ubuntu installation. Linux 64bit will be installed.

As my focus is mainly on Data Science and Machine Learning, this guide will include many of the standard libraries and programs used withhin the community.



## Versions
- [Ubuntu 14.04 LTS](Ubuntu_14_04LTS.md): Old file to setup a workstation with Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and some of the main libraries and drivers (NVIDIA-driver, cuda, caffe, opencv, etc.). This will no longer be maintained.
- [Ubuntu 16.04 LTS](Ubuntu_16_04LTS.md): This is the new guide and more and more content will be added. If i find time, I may publish a blogpost covering some of the stuff.
